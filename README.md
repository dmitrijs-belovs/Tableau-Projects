## Introduction

This repository contains various data analysis projects completed in Tableau that showcase my data visualization and Tableau skills.

## Telco Customer Churn

### Description

The first project includes an analysis dashboard of customer churn in Telco, a fictional telecommunications company that provided home phone and Internet services to 7043 customers in California in Q3. The [Telco dataset](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/businessanalytics/blogs/steven-macko/2019/07/11/telco-customer-churn-1113) is an IBM sample dataset that is widely used for practicing data analysis and machine learning. It consists of 6 .xslx files and contains information on:

* demographic info about customers – gender, age, martial status, dependents and location
* customer account info – tenure, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
* services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
* customer churn metrics - churn label (which customers left and which stayed), churn score, churn resaon and CLTV

This information allows analyzing differences between customers who left and stayed by demographic info, account info, and services signed up for. Furthermore, it allows analyzing churn reasons and other key churn metrics such as churn score and customer lifetime value (CLTV). All of this should help explore possible reasons for customer churn and design customer retention strategies.

The dataset is pre-processed, ensures data quality and consistency, and allows to start directly with data analysis.
