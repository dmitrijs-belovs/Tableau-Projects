## Introduction

This repository contains various data analysis projects completed in Tableau that showcase my data visualization and Tableau skills.

## Telco Customer Churn

### Description

The first project includes an analysis of customer churn in Telco, a fictional telecommunications company that provides home phone and Internet services to customers in California. The Telco dataset is widely used for practicing data analysis, and is available for download on this [Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn/data).

The dataset contains information on:

* customer churn - which customers left last month and which stayed
* services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
* customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
* demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents

This information allows analyzing differences between customers who left and stayed by services signed up for, account information, and demographic info. Furthermore, it allows calculations of customer lifetime value (CLTV) and other key churn metrics. All of this should help explore possible reasons for customer churn and design customer retention strategies.
